# Runbooks — manual operational procedures

Step-by-step for the **manual** operations that aren't (or can't be) fully automated. Each entry:
**when** to use it · **why** it's manual · the **steps** · **safety** (idempotency / blast radius).

Prefer automation where it exists (e.g. reference-data now deploy-seeds via `migrate.yml` on every push
to `main`). A runbook here is for the genuinely-manual or break-glass cases. When a manual step recurs,
consider promoting it to a script or CI job and replacing the entry with a pointer.

> Anything touching **prod data** or **secrets**: double-check you're on the **production** Neon
> branch/database (not a dev branch), and prefer an **idempotent, guarded** statement so a re-run is a
> no-op.

## Rename / correct a seeded profile in prod

**When:** the seed changed a profile's name (or similar reference value) but prod already had the row.
The seed is `ON CONFLICT (public_id) DO NOTHING`, so it **won't overwrite** an existing row — a
one-off `UPDATE` is needed. (First occurrence: V1-3 renamed the seed profile "Athlete One" → "Liam",
but prod kept "Athlete One".)

**Why manual:** deliberately not in the seed — an `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET name` would clobber a
name a user later edits. A targeted, guarded correction is safer as a one-off.

**Steps** (Neon dashboard → **mat-plan** project → confirm the **production** database → **SQL Editor**):

```sql
UPDATE profiles
SET name = 'Liam', updated_at = now()
WHERE public_id = '019826b4-0000-7000-8000-000000000001'  -- the target row's public_id
  AND name = 'Athlete One'                                 -- guard → no-op if already renamed
  AND deleted_at IS NULL;
```

Expect `UPDATE 1` (or `UPDATE 0` if already done). Verify:

```sql
SELECT public_id, name, kind FROM profiles WHERE deleted_at IS NULL ORDER BY id;
```

**Safety:** targets one row by `public_id`; the `name =` guard makes it idempotent; bumps `updated_at`
for LWW hygiene; skips soft-deleted rows.

## Manually re-seed / re-apply prod (`workflow_dispatch`)

**When:** you need the prod migrate+seed to run out-of-band (e.g. a catch-up before the change merges,
or after wiring the `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` secret). Since `migrate.yml` now runs on **every** push to
`main`, this is rarely needed — merging is usually enough.

**Steps:** GitHub → **Actions** → **"Migrate + seed (production)"** → **Run workflow** → branch `main`
→ Run. Check the "Apply migrations + idempotent seed" step didn't print the `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED …
skipping` warning.

**Safety:** `db:migrate` is a no-op when nothing is pending; `db:seed` is idempotent.

## Rotate a secret (Neon password / access-gate code / GitHub Actions secret)

_TODO — document rotating `DATABASE_URL(_UNPOOLED)`, `ACCESS_GATE_PASSWORD`, and the GitHub Actions
secret; update `.env.local` + Vercel env + the GH secret together; note what re-deploys are needed._

## Cut a Neon RESTORE branch before a destructive/backfill migration (rollback prep)

_TODO — document creating a pre-migration Neon restore point/branch (AGENTS.md "Rollback"), and how to
swap to it if a backfill goes wrong._

## Promote `e2e` to a required check (branch protection)

_TODO — the repo-admin branch-protection change to make the `e2e` check required (the PR-28 milestone);
the `ci-skip-e2e` label + auto-skip already keep it green for irrelevant/docs PRs._

## Recover prod after a bad migration / restore from a Neon branch

_TODO — restore-from-branch procedure + how to reconcile the migration journal afterward._

## First-time environment setup (Neon + Vercel + secrets)

_See [deploy.md](./deploy.md) — the one-time Neon/Vercel/secret wiring lives there._
